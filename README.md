# Early Detection of Alzheimer's Disease Using CNN on Brain MRI

This
research is initiated to compare the impact of different activation functions between
ReLU, ELU, and SoftMax on the performance of a CNNs model for early detection of AD from brain MRI scans. Besides, this research also aims to compare the performance of adaptive learning rate methods, RMSProp and Adam on a CNN model.

The dataset used for this research is OASIS-
2: Longitudinal MRI Data in Nondemented and Demented Older Adults (OASIS-2)
which is obtained from the OASIS database.
